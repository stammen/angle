ANGLE -- ms-holographic-experimental
=====

This experimental branch has changes that allow you to use ANGLE to run OpenGL ES code on 
HoloLens, or on any other device that supports Windows Holographic - such as the Microsoft HoloLens
Emulator.

In this branch, ANGLE has been updated to recognize a holographic space and a spatial coordinate 
system. These are passed in by the app when ANGLE is initialized; the holographic space replaces
the native CoreWindow in the surface creation properties, and the spatial coordinate system is
also provided as a surface creation property. This coordinate system will be used to create stereo
view and projection matrices that are provided to the shader pipeline by ANGLE.

## Holographic rendering

The ANGLE app can draw in stereo using the optimized instanced rendering technique that is supported 
by Microsoft HoloLens. The additional optimization to set the render target array index without 
using a geometry shader is detected and enabled when running on applicable hardware. Two drawing modes 
are supported: simple, and advanced.

Simple drawing: ANGLE provides a view matrix to the app that represents the holographic camera, but
from a mono viewpoint. This viewpoint is midway between both eye positions of the holographic camera.
In this case, the app is expected to use that view matrix to determine camera position, and it is 
expected to use a projection matrix that is the identity matrix - or no projection matrix at all. 
Internally, ANGLE will will double the number of instances provided to the shader so that there are
enough instances for stereo rendering. When drawing in this mode, the actual instance ID is halved 
before it is provided to the app's shader code so that no modifications to the GLSL are necessary. 
Also, ANGLE will modify the shader to undo the mid-view matrix, and then apply the left or right 
view/projection matrices to alternate instances.

Advanced drawing: In this mode, the app can uses its own instanced draw calls to provide stereo
rendering. The shader will not be modified. The app should render with the Windows Holographic view/
projection matrix, and the app is responsible for setting up stereo instanced drawing.

Full support for the first holographic camera is included.

## Image stabilization

This version of ANGLE can also apply automatic image stabilization based on the depth buffer. This 
feature determines a best-fit plane for the scene geometry by processing geometry data from the 
depth buffer, and then provides the focus point and plane to Windows Holographic. 

To take advantage of this feature, make sure to apply the following rules when drawing content:
  * All information in the depth buffer should be for hologram geometry that is visible
    to the user.
  * Don't draw pixels to the depth buffer to provide occlusion. Do occlusion last
    instead; overwrite color pixels and turn off depth writes.
  * Avoid rendering techniques that overwrite the depth buffer with other data.

If the above rules cannot be applied, the feature for automatic depth-based image stabilization should
not be enabled.

## Spatial reference frames

The frame of reference provided by the app can be stationary, or it can be attached to a device.

Also, the reference frame can be changed on-the-fly via EGL. Example code:

    // Get the default SpatialLocator.
    SpatialLocator^ locator = SpatialLocator::GetDefault();

    // Create an attached frame of reference.
    auto attachedFrameOfReference = locator->CreateAttachedFrameOfReferenceAtCurrentHeading();

    // Provide the attached frame of reference to ANGLE. It will be used to create holographic 
    // view matrices from then on.
    eglExtSurfaceAttribPointerANGLE(
        mEglDisplay, mEglSurface, 
        EGLEXT_HOLOGRAPHIC_SPATIAL_FRAME_OF_REFERENCE_ANGLE, 
        reinterpret_cast<IInspectable*>(attachedFrameOfReference));

## ANGLE app templates for Windows Holographic

To see the changes you will need to make to your app, take a look at the app template. Two are
provided - one for the simple drawing mode, and one for the advanced drawing mode. Instructions 
for installing the templates are provided later in this document.


## Remarks

This branch contains code that is a work-in-progress; it is not fully tested. You may encounter 
issues while using it.

**Note** This branch requires Visual Studio 2015 Update 2 to build, and a Windows Holographic 
device to execute. Windows Holographic devices include the Microsoft HoloLens and the Microsoft 
HoloLens Emulator.

To obtain information about Windows 10 development, go to the [Windows Dev Center]
(http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=532421).

To obtain information about the tools used for Windows Holographic development, including
Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and the Microsoft HoloLens Emulator, go to
[Install the tools](https://developer.microsoft.com/windows/holographic/install_the_tools).

## System requirements

**For holographic apps:** Windows 10 Holographic

## Build ANGLE with Windows Holographic experimental support included

1. Clone the repo: ```git clone [https://github.com/stammen/angle.git](https://github.com/Microsoft/angle.git) angle```
2. Checkout the mr branch:

```
    cd angle
    git checkout mr
```

3. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.
4. Starting in the folder where you cloned the branch, go to winrt\10\src\ and open angle.sln.
5. Set your target platform to Win32 or x64, and set Debug or Release as desired.
6. Right-click on the libAngle project and select **Build**.

## Build the ANGLE UWP app template with Windows Holographic experimental support included

**Note: You will need to manually copy the Holographic templates to Visual Studio 2017 
Copy the templates\10\Windows folder to Documents\Visual Studio 2017\Templates\ProjectTemplates\ 

1. Open an Explorer window and go to the folder where you cloned the experimental branch.

1. Navigate to templates\ and run install.bat.

1. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **New ** \> **Project**.

1. Under **Templates** \> **Visual C\+\+** \> **Windows** \> **Universal**, select 
   **App for OpenGL ES (Windows Universal)** or **Holographic App for OpenGL ES (Windows 
   Universal)**.
   
1. Name your app, select a folder, and click **OK**.

1. Set your target platform to x86 or x64, and set Debug or Release as desired. You will need to update the project settings. Right click on the Holographic project and select Retarget Projects. Set SDK Version and SDK Min. Version to 10.0.16299.0 
Set Platform Toolset to v141 

1. Right-click on your app project and select **Build**.

**Note:** You may now begin development, or proceed to build and run the sample content.

## Run the sample

The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the app, or you want to both deploy and
run it.

### Deploying to the Microsoft HoloLens emulator

- Click the debug target drop-down, and select **Microsoft HoloLens Emulator**.
- Select **Build** \> **Deploy** Solution.

### Deploying to a Microsoft HoloLens

- Developer unlock your Microsoft HoloLens. For instructions, go to [Enable your device for development]
  (https://msdn.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/get-started/enable-your-device-for-development#enable-your-windows-10-devices).
- Find the IP address of your Microsoft HoloLens. The IP address can be found in **Settings**
  \> **Network & Internet** \> **Wi-Fi** \> **Advanced options**. Or, you can ask Cortana for this
  information by saying: "Hey Cortana, what's my IP address?"
- Right-click on your project in Visual Studio, and then select **Properties**.
- In the Debugging pane, click the drop-down and select **Remote Machine**.
- Enter the IP address of your Microsoft HoloLens into the field labelled **Machine Name**.
- Click **OK**.
- Select **Build** \> **Deploy** Solution.

### Pairing your developer-unlocked Microsoft HoloLens with Visual Studio

The first time you deploy from your development PC to your developer-unlocked Microsoft HoloLens,
you will need to use a PIN to pair your PC with the Microsoft HoloLens.
- When you select **Build** \> **Deploy Solution**, a dialog box will appear for Visual Studio to
  accept the PIN.
- On your Microsoft HoloLens, go to **Settings** \> **Update** \> **For developers**, and click on
  **Pair**.
- Type the PIN displayed by your Microsoft HoloLens into the Visual Studio dialog box and click
  **OK**.
- On your Microsoft HoloLens, select **Done** to accept the pairing.
- The solution will then start to deploy.

### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, follow the steps listed above to connect your
  developer-unlocked Microsoft HoloLens, then press F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Debugging**.
  To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or select **Debug** \> **Start Without Debugging**.
